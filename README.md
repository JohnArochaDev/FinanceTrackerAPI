# TO DO
1. Prepare user flow. The create-finance route should allow a full 3 chart each with 1 data set upload, test to be sure.
2. Test an update user flow, if the user changes one small section it should update accordingly.
3. Add business logic for the user's maximum budget, deficit, amount of $ left over, complete all of that on the back end.
4. Add a slideshow registration to a new user on the FE, with a variable that tells the FE if the user has completed registration or not.
5. Marry the FE and BE together, and run tests.
